Timelapse stuff by dop3j0e
==========================

Some of my timelapse videos yielded interesting AviSynth scripts or useful Python hacks. Here they are, maybe someone can reuse them.

"h4x0rz in space" is the source to my [graffitti timelapse](http://vimeo.com/32865163).

"tools" has the tools I wrote for that timelapse and [that other one](http://vimeo.com/45386061).
