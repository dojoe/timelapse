This is the source to my first large timelapse; the result is on Vimeo: [http://vimeo.com/32865163](http://vimeo.com/32865163)

I did all the titling, fading and overlay stuff in a single AviSynth script -- you are free to use and modify it for whatever you like, but I recommend you just take some ideas from it and write your own script from scratch.
